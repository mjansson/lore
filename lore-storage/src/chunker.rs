//! Streaming content-defined chunking.
//!
//! Cuts a file into content-defined fragments without ever holding it whole. The
//! chunker keeps a window of `2 * FRAGMENT_SIZE_THRESHOLD` bytes and only cuts while
//! at least one maximum-sized fragment is buffered, so every cut decision sees the
//! same lookahead it would with the entire file resident. The emitted boundaries are
//! therefore identical to running [`fastcdc::v2020::FastCDC`] over the whole buffer,
//! which the tests below assert directly — a boundary change would rewrite every
//! fragment hash in every repository.
//!
//! A window is half read target, half headroom for the bytes the previous cut could
//! not decide. Any file bigger than one window gets two windows: the next read runs
//! in one while chunks are cut and handed out from the other, so disk latency is off
//! the critical path, and the undecided remainder travels into the incoming window's
//! headroom so the cut logic never sees the seam. A file that fits in a single read
//! gets one window, no headroom and no read-ahead.
//!
//! A cut queues boundaries, not bytes; the chunk is copied out of the window when it
//! is handed over, which is also when the caller charges it to the fragment budget.
//! Peak residency is therefore the windows themselves, which is exactly what the
//! reservation in [`FileChunker::open`] covers.
//!
//! Each read is one blocking call, keeping the whole scan off the async workers: the
//! previous whole-file approach mapped the file and faulted every page in
//! synchronously from a core worker. Phase 2 of the async file I/O proposal replaces
//! the read with the owned-buffer positional API; the windowing, pipelining and cut
//! logic above it is unaffected.
