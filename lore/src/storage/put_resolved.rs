//! `lore_storage_put_resolved` — store a buffer and publish a mutable key naming it.
//!
//! The write side of `lore_storage_get_resolved`: it stores the content, then maps `key` to the
//! content's hash under `KeyType::Resolve`. It is not the only writer of that mapping —
//! `lore_storage_mutable_store` accepts the same key type, a publish large enough to fragment
//! finishes with an ordinary mutable store write, and `get_resolved` caches the mapping it reads
//! — but it is the only one that guarantees the content is stored before the key names it.
//!
//! Publishing is last-writer-wins, deliberately and not provisionally. Concurrent publishers of
//! one key all succeed and the last write is what the key names; nobody is told they were
//! overwritten. That is the right contract for the foreign-keyed caching this exists for, where
//! either mapping is valid. A caller who must detect a lost update stores with
//! `lore_storage_put` and publishes with `lore_storage_mutable_compare_and_swap`, paying the
//! second round trip. Folding the swap in here is not available: content must be stored before
//! the key names it, so a failed swap would strand the content it just stored, and worst under
//! exactly the contention that would motivate it.
//!
//! Backend selection matches `lore_storage_put` rather than the read ops: the local store always
//! receives both the content and the mapping, and `remote_write = 1` additionally publishes them
//! to the remote (unless `globals.offline`/`local` vetoes it). There is no local-then-remote
//! fallback here — that is a read concept.
//!
//! Per-item behaviour:
//! - `partition == Partition::default()`, a zero `key`, or `data.len > 0 && data.ptr == NULL`:
//!   rejects with `error_code = INVALID_ARGUMENTS`; other items run independently.
//! - `data.len == 0`: **removes** the mapping. No content is stored; the key is set to the zero
//!   hash, which is how the mutable store deletes a key, and `get_resolved` then reports
//!   `ADDRESS_NOT_FOUND` for it. The terminal event carries the zero address.
//!
//!   With `remote_write = 0` this only evicts the *local* mapping. The local mutable store is a
//!   cache, not an authority — a zero mapping is indistinguishable from one that was never
//!   cached, and a resolve falls through to the remote either way. So a key that was published
//!   remotely reappears on the next resolve unless the delete reached the remote too. Deleting a
//!   published key requires `remote_write = 1`.
//! - Otherwise: `write_resolved`, and the stored address is reported in `PUT_ITEM_COMPLETE`.
//!
//! Emits the same `PUT_ITEM_COMPLETE` as `lore_storage_put`, where `address` is the content the
//! key now resolves to — so a caller can hand it straight to `get` — and `stored_local` /
//! `stored_remote` report where it actually landed.
//!
//! `stored_remote` is what gates the remote mapping: a remote content upload that fails still
//! leaves a successful local write, so rather than publish a key naming content the server does
//! not hold, the remote publish is skipped and `stored_remote` is reported as 0. A caller that
//! needs the key visible remotely checks that field rather than `error_code`.
