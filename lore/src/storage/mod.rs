//! Content-addressed storage API.
//!
//! Exposes the `ImmutableStore` / `MutableStore` primitives as a first-class
//! C ABI surface that can be driven without a filesystem working tree.
//!
//! C ABI types referenced by the API live in their original crates:
//! `Partition` in `lore_base::types`, `StoreMatch` in
//! `lore_storage::store_types`, `LoreBytes` and `LoreErrorCode` in
//! `lore_revision::event`. The handle type [`handle::LoreStore`] is defined
//! here.
//!
//! # Callback contract
//!
//! Every entry point in this module accepts a `LoreEventCallback` that the runtime invokes
//! synchronously to deliver per-item events, the terminal `Complete`, and the final `End`.
//! The callback **must not re-enter the storage API on the same handle**. Re-entry —
//! invoking another `lore_storage_*` call from inside the callback — risks deadlock against
//! the in-flight counter and the per-handle dispatch path. Callers that need to chain ops
//! should record the result and dispatch from the caller's own thread after `End` fires.
//!
//! Re-entry on a different handle is allowed but discouraged: the second call's events
//! interleave with the first's on the caller's event stream and there is no runtime
//! enforcement that prevents the deadlock if both calls happen to share resources. Treat
//! the callback as a notification sink, not a control point.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use std::sync::Mutex;
//! use lore_revision::event::LoreEvent;
//! use lore_revision::interface::LoreEventCallback;
//!
//! let captured: std::sync::Arc<Mutex<Vec<LoreEvent>>> = Default::default();
//! let captured_for_cb = captured.clone();
//! let callback: LoreEventCallback = Some(Box::new(move |event: &LoreEvent| {
//!     // Record the event — DO NOT call back into lore::storage::* here.
//!     captured_for_cb.lock().unwrap().push(event.clone());
//! }));
//! // ... pass `callback` to lore::storage::put / get / etc.
//! ```

/// and running the close sequence on each. Client-mode handles (no connection id recorded)
/// are unaffected. Per-handle drains run in parallel.
///
/// IPC buffer-bearing args policy: `lore_storage_put` and `lore_storage_put_resolved` carry a
/// `LoreBytes` view into caller memory in their *args*, which has no natural cross-process
/// representation. `LoreBytes::deserialize` always errors, so those args cannot be reconstructed
/// on the server side of the IPC boundary. `lore_storage_put_file` and
/// `lore_storage_put_file_resolved` name a path instead, so they carry across it unchanged and are
/// the delegable way to write content a service holds on disk.
///
/// Two caveats worth knowing before relying on this. Nothing enforces it: every op goes through
/// `dispatch_call` and is delegated whenever service mode is active, and the failure surfaces as
/// a message that fails to read — dropping the connection — rather than as the `InvalidArguments`
/// a caller would expect. And the read ops (`lore_storage_get`, `lore_storage_get_resolved`) are
/// *not* in this family despite emitting `LoreBytes`: they carry it only in events, whose
/// lifetime is the callback, so their args round-trip fine.
///
